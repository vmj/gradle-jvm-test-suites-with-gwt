# Example

## Run

  .\gradlew tomcatRun

And open http://localhost:8080/app/ in your browser.

## Test

  .\gradlew test
  .\gradlew gwtMockitoTest
  .\gradlew test5
  .\gradlew integrationTest

NOTE: Some test suites do not work without a patched `gwt-gradle-plugin`
and disabling the GWT Test task configuration. (See commit history.)
